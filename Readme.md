# Dezirae's Walk from Class
#### My First Map

I decided to make this map which represents my walk from Leon Levine Hall to campus. The walk is approximately 2 miles and even though it follows a busy street, it is quite therapeutic. I added Kovu coffee as a stop because occasionally I'll treat myself to a dirty chai. My other additional stop is Daniel Boone Inn. I work here so it is frequently on my route to the library if I park at the restaurant.
